# <p align="center"> MediBlock - A Medical Record Management Platform using Blockchain  </p>

# Target Theme/Domain: E-Healthcare

# Problem Statement
**INDIAâ€™S THREE-TIER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM (Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Healthcare Centre)**

- Highly centralised & unorganised.
- Depends on Paper-based documentation. 
- Relies on the user (patient) to keep track of their medical records. 

**LIMITATIONS OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM (EHR)**
- Patient details remain in the same hospital and cannot be shared with other hospitals. This is because the data is not interoperable and semantic.

**RISK OF PATIENT PRIVACY VIOLATION (Identity thefts, Spamming, Financial data crimes)**

- One in five employees working in the healthcare sector is willing to sell sensitive medical data to unauthorised parties. 
- No proof of ownership over personal data. 
- Hospitals Profiting off the patient's data for research purposes.

**FINANCIAL ISSUES**

- Present a disincentive for hospitals and physicians to adopt and implement an EHR. 

# Idea/Solution

MediBlock is a secure and decentralised medical record management platform that provides secure storage of electronic records (EHR) on blockchain by defining granular access rules for the users so that no one without access can see the content of blockchain unless the permission is granted to the user.
